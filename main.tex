    %\cvsection{Me}{
    %    Hi, as of writing my CV, I am an 8th semester student in Software Engineering at Aalborg University. 
    %    I have a bachelor in Computer Engineering. 
    %    My personal interests include; gaming, D\&D, programming and Linux.
    %    In terms of programming I take particular interest in functional programming, but anything that can enhance my experience as a Linux user is also interesting to me.
    %    As a person who plays video games in Linux, it also provides challenges, so i have experience with tweaking various graphical drivers and layers in the graphical software stack in Linux.
