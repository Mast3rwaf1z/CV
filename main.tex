    \cvsection{Me}{
        Hi, as of writing my CV, I am an 8th semester student in Software Engineering at Aalborg University. 
        I have a bachelor in Computer Engineering. 
        My personal interests include; gaming, D\&D, programming and Linux.

        In terms of programming I take particular interest in functional programming, but anything that can enhance my experience as a Linux user is also interesting to me.
        As a person who plays video games in Linux, it also provides challenges, so i have experience with tweaking various graphical drivers and layers in the graphical software stack in Linux.

    \cvsection{Significant Projects}{
        \textbf{Bachelor Project: } An interesting research project where we made a series of tests for a testbed and actually acquired some interesting results. 
        In this project I learned a lot about computer networking and tools you can use to interface with the networking functionality in the Linux kernel.

        \textbf{Skademaskinen: } My server, in conjunction with a friend from Aalborg University I have used various computer parts to create a server which hosts a variety of software I have written.
        Available on \href{https://github.com/Skademaskinen}{Github}.

        \textbf{ASCK: } As a member of Aalborg Supercomputer Klub I have not contributed a lot yet, but I plan to contribute more before I finish my studies. 
        I have experimented a little with HPL and their Rock5B SBC's.

    \cvsection{Work Experience}{
        \textbf{DEIS: } During my bachelor studies, I worked as a student programmer at DEIS, a research unit of Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University. 
        This job was focused on making a GUI solution for a framework for a course in Distributed Systems.

        \textbf{F-Klubben: } I have worked as a volunteer at F-klubben, an association for students and employees at Department of Computer Science. 
        As a member of the association my role has primarily been as a contributer to their software, most notably working on \href{https://github.com/f-klubben/fnix}{fnix}.
